## to-dos

[ ] add basic css
[ ] image optimization/thumbnail generation
[ ] make local shortcut for referencing images and stuff (so we don't have to do /artifacts/[name]/image.png each time)
[ ] filter by skill
[ ] system for custom page view stuff (send specific selection of things to specific companies/employers)
[ ] automatic favicon setup in build (probably very doable!)
[ ] add a bunch of portfolio items
[ ] have claude help me determine most useful tags to show my work and for employers to see what they want
[ ] credits page
[ ] my skills page (with examples linked for each)
[ ] writing/blog page?
[ ] add time and tags (filed under: and a link to the tag) to each artifact
[ ] add a category page for each tag, with a cheeky description
[ ] add a tag browser?
[ ] make picture for each listing clickable
[ ] have claude strengthen elements in html head
[ ] have claude inventory artifacts and determine what needs what (process videos, any artwork at all, etc)
[ ] figure out more of a standard for the subtitle lines

### portfolio pieces missing
