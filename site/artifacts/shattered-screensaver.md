i'm a big fan of the [deco screensaver from the ancient xscreensaver collection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfdDTv07Nhw), but always wished it could be segmented into parts that aren't rectangles. so i made it!

full code on [github](https://github.com/oddhorse/shattered). install it for yourself [here](https://github.com/oddhorse/shattered/releases/tag/v1.0.0)!
