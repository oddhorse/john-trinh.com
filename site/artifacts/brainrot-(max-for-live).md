sometimes you need to lock in. sometimes you need some extra concentration in that ableton live session. being german, ableton does not know how to have any sort of fun offer a good solution for this. thank god i do! shoutout tiktok shoutout peter griffin. this is just what the doctor ordered!

on the backend this runs an html+js page with the youtube api and maxjs hooks to communicate with the max environment.
no download available yet so you will have to trust (or ask me) gumroad up soon lol
