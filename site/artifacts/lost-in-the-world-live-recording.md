i made this setup for college auditions. ended up taking like a month straight. i would go to work, leave work, lock myself in this room, and grind the shit out. i was inefficient and inexperienced and oh so passionate. i would be much faster doing this now of course, but i'm sure all that practice is why!

i love the idea of the "cult setup" floor arrangement. might have to revisit for irl performances.

listen here!
