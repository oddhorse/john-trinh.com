TODO: finish!
ring modulator built for rattling everything else in a song with a bass signal. pick a bass signal as your sidechain, dial in an optional lowpass, and pick the amount of ringmod to apply. automatically gain-compensates the output for the fastest possible results! optional output clipping too. GRUBBLER may be specific, but it's an effect i use too often and it's already saved me so much time and headache compared to a manual workflow!
