short film made with two friends, [liv curry](https://www.instagram.com/1.1.1.1.i.v/) and [zoe mueller](https://www.instagram.com/friendlygirlonline/). originally for north springs charter high school film festival in 2022, but it was cancelled and we were very disappointed about that.

BODACH is incredibly dumb in concept but aesthetically superb.
