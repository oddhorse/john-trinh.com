TODO: finish!
max for live performance tool for easy instrument rack/audio effect rack chain selection. its back/forward buttons let you flip between instruments or effect chains with midi pads or keys, and its configurable pop-up window can display the currently selected chain (and chain color) in as large a font as you want! perfect for performance environments where you must be on the right instrument. also has an automation-friendly dial control that can be overridden by the back/forward buttons! very flexible
