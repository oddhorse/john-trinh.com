i thought it would be fun to 3d model my head. i'd been learning about hair modeling systems in blender so i figured i'd give myself some nice hair too. my face has since changed shape so i might redo this soon!

used keentools facebuilder (back when it was free and not like $180 per year) for modeling and texturing. used photoshop to extend the texture beyond the stitched one.
